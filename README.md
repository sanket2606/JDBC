# Student Application Using JDBC and MySQL Database

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of setting up a student application that utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a MySQL database. It outlines the necessary steps to create and configure the database, as well as provides links to relevant resources.

## Database Setup

### 1. Install MySQL Database Server

- **Download MySQL:** Visit the official MySQL website (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/) to download the MySQL database server appropriate for your operating system.

- **Installation Guides:** Refer to MySQL's official documentation for installation guides based on your specific OS: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/

### 2. MySQL Workbench (Optional)

- **Download MySQL Workbench:** MySQL Workbench is a GUI tool for managing MySQL databases. You can download it from here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

- **Workbench Documentation:** Check the MySQL Workbench documentation for guides on how to use it effectively: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/

### 3. Create a Database

- Open MySQL Workbench or a MySQL client.

- Use SQL commands to create a new database:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;
Replace "StudentDB" with your preferred database name.
4. Create Tables
Use SQL commands to create tables within the database. For example, you might create a "Students" table:

- Use SQL commands to create a new database:
  ```sql
  CREATE DATABASE StudentDB;
Replace "StudentDB" with your preferred database name.
4. Create Tables
Use SQL commands to create tables within the database. For example, you might create a "Students" table:
CREATE TABLE Student (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    lastName VARCHAR(50),
    address VARCHAR(100),
    mobaile BIGINT, -- Assuming you want to store mobile numbers as a number (without hyphens or other characters)
    dob DATE,
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    parcentage INT
);


sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    major VARCHAR(50)
);
Customize the table structure according to your application requirements.

JDBC Setup
1. Download and Install Java
Download Java: If you don't have Java installed, download and install it from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
2. JDBC Driver
Download JDBC Driver: You'll need the MySQL JDBC driver to connect to your MySQL database. Download it from the official MySQL website:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/
3. Set Up Your IDE
If you're using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or NetBeans, add the JDBC driver to your project's classpath.
4. Code Development
Write your Java application code that utilizes JDBC to connect to the MySQL database and interact with the data.
